                      <h3>Life in Puerto Rico</h3>
                      <img src="images/636002556228698101257681652_puerto-rico-el-morro.jpg" height="200" width="325" class="txtwrap1"/>
                      <p>I was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1979. As a young boy I became interested in technology and in how the                          inner working of the technology, when family members brought home pieces of damaged equipment for me to play with.                          Instead of playing with the equipment I took it upon myself to explore inside the machines and tried to get them in                          working order. As I kept growing into a teenager my thirst for knowledge also grew. When I saw a computer in the garbage,                  I remember that I picked them up and explored the insides of these magnificent devices and became familiar with some of                          its components. As I graduated high school I found work at the United States Postal Service in Puerto Rico. After a few                          years working for the postal service I felt that I wanted more out of life and decided to enroll in a technical school                          for Electrcian and Electronics Aprentice Technician. I graduated with awesome grades and found work immediately at one of                        the biggest pharmaceutical conglomerateS in the world Pfizer P.G.M.</p>
                      <img src="images/El-Yunque.jpg" class="txtwrap2" height="200" width="325" />
                     <p>At Pfizer I became a machine operator, operating packaging machines that packaged different types of medications and also                        performed  maintenance of the packaging machines. A year passed and the company offered me a promotion to Machine Operator                        Team Lead and of course I took the promotion. After a couple of years I overheard people that I worked with talking about                        this new plant that the company was about to open in Terre Haute, Indiana. I payed no mind because I had never heard about                        Terre Haute in my life. Well a few months passed and I got offered a a temporary assignment, guess where......
                       You guessed it, the temporary assignment was In Terre Haute Indiana. I took the assignment, it consisted in training their                        crew in the maintenance and operation of these packaging machines. I was traveling back and forward from Indiana to Puerto                        Rico every month to check on my things back home. After six months the managers at the plant in Tterre Haute approached me                        and asked me if I wanted to become a permanent team lead there in the plant, and once again I took the position.</p>

                      <h3>Life in Terre Haute</h3>
                      <img src="images/Pfizer_Logo.svg.png" class="txtwrap2" height="175" width="275"/>
                      <p>After accepting the permanent position I was moving all of my things to Terre Haute the next month. At the Terre Haute
                       facility I rapidly established myself as an example of excellence and was awarded a position as a trainer for the packaging                       line temporary agency employees that Pfizer hired. After a year of moving to Terre Haute the outlook for the company was                       not looking good, so they started to layoff some of the temporary employess because the product that we were making at the                       facility was not doing so good. A few months passed and the the market crash of 2008 was in full bloom, one morning getting                       ready for work Ii was watching the news and saw that pfizer had given the order to close some of their facilitties arond                       the country. I never gave thought that one of those facilities might have been the one I was working at. It came time to                       leave for work and after I arrived and to my surprise the gates were closed with a gigantic lock and a note that read                       "Facility has been closed, please proceed to the theater". I went to the little theater room for a plant meeting and for an                       explination of what was going on. At the meeting they explained to us that the product that we were making was making                        people sick and crystallizing their lungs, so corporate and management made the decision to close the facility down and                       layoff all of the employees.</p>
                       
                       <img src="images/alorica.png" class="txtwrap1" height="150" width="225" />
                       <p>So once again I found myself looking for employment, and if you know about Terre Haute you wold know that employment
                       opportunities in Terre Haute are scarce now that Pfizer is gone. So I spent a few months looking for a job until I found
                       employment at Sony DADC picking and packing orders. After a few months Sony announced that they were packing up and
                       leaving town and that there will be a masive layoff coming in the coming weeks. So once again Ii saw at the prospects
                       of losing my job so I started looking for a job once again. Fortunately there was a big company coming in to Terre Haute	                       that would be hiring and of course I applied and landed a job at Alorica Inc. Alorica is the company that AT&T outsources
                       their customer service call centers to. I spent around 8 months working there until I got tired of the enviroment in Terre                       Haute. I had been visiting the town of Plainfield for quite a while and I liked the town, because it was a booming town and                       there was a lot of things to do so i fell in love with the town. At the beggining of 2009 I decided that it was time for a                       change, so me and my family packed up and left Terre Haute...... Good Riddance!!!!!!</p>

                 <div id="indiana2" class="tabcontent">
                      <h3>Life in Plainfield</h3>
                      <img src="images/10624759_1489284414664547_2286910600247373736_n.jpg" width="150" height="200" class="txtwrap1" />
                     <p>So I moved to plainfield Indiana and immediately found work at a warehouse and worked there for about 3 years, but                        I yearned for something more. Here is where I found Ivy Tech Community College. After deciding to go back to school, I                        started hearing about the IT program that Ivy Tech has and I must say it is one of the best community colleges in the                        nation when we talk about IT education. I Said to myself "Angel This is your moment, this is what you have been wanting                        all your life ...... go for it". So I did go for it. At Ivy Tech I became a recognized student. I was in the Deans List                        for 4 semesters in a row with a G.P.A of 3.74 and inducted into The National Society Of Leadership And Success as an                        alumni. I graduated with a magna cumlaude on May 11, 2013. But an Associates Degree was not enough for me. As I started to                        look for job in the IT field I started noticing that there was a need for more advanced technicians with a Bachelors                        Degree, so I went and enrolled at IUPUI for my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a concentration in Web Development.                        Currently I am 1 year away from graduating with a G.P.A of 3.5. </p>
